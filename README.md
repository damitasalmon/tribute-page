##Project Description

This project is a part of [FreeCodecamp](https://freecodecamp.com)'s Basic Frond End Development project challenges. 

**Objective:** Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to [this](http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/wMQrXV).

* **Rule #1:** Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.
* **Rule #2:** Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries you need. Give it your own personal style.
* **User Story:** I can view a tribute page with an image and text.
* **User Story:** I can click on a link that will take me to an external website with further information on the topic.
